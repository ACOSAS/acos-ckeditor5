# Editor and content styles

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is distributed with two types of styles:

* Editor styles, which style the editor's user interface.
* Content styles, which style the content in the editor.

If you went through our {@link getting-started/quick-start Quick start}, you probably noticed that attaching the styles is pretty standard, and we provide a CSS stylesheet that has both editor and content stylesheets combined:

```js
import 'ckeditor5/dist/index.css';

// If you are using premium features:
import 'ckeditor5-premium-features/dist/index.css'; 
```

Or in HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/dist/index.css" />

<!-- If you are using premium features: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/dist/index.css" />
```

## Why do I need content styles?

Some {@link features/index core editor features} bring additional CSS to control the look of the content they produce. Take, for example, the {@link features/images-overview image feature} that needs special content styles to render images and their captions in the content. Or the {@link module:block-quote/blockquote~BlockQuote block quote} feature that displays quotes in italics with a subtle border on the side.

## Styling the published content

Usually your application is divided to two parts. Content creation, which hosts the editor and is a writing tool, and content publishing, which presents the written content.

It is important to use the content styles on the publishing side of your application. Otherwise, the content will look differenty in the editor and for your end users.

There are two ways to obtain the content styles:

// TODO: Links

* From our `npm` packages, in the `dist/index-content.css` location.
* From CDN, `<CDN_LINK>`

Load the `index-content.css` file on the publishing side by adding the following code to the template:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/assets/index-content.css">
```

<info-box warning>
	**Important!**

	If you take a closer look at the content styles, you may notice they are prefixed with the `.ck-content` class selector. This narrows their scope when used in CKEditor&nbsp;5 so they do not affect the rest of the application. To use them in the frontâ€“end, **you will have to** add the `ck-content` CSS class to the container of your content. Otherwise, the styles will not be applied.

## Optimizing the size of stylesheets

Our main packages, `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features`, distribute three stylesheets:

* `index.css`: combined editor and content styles.
* `index-content.css`: only content styles.
* `index-editor.css`: only editor styles.

TODO: Link
Content styles include styles for **all** plugins of the editor. If you want to optimize the size of the stylesheet, as you may be using minimal set of plugins, read our optimization guide.
