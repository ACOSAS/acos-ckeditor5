# Quick Start

This guide will show you the fastest way to start using CKEditor&nbsp;5.

## Try CKEditor&nbsp;5 builder

Check out the builder to quickly get a taste of CKEditor. It offers an easy-to-use UI to help you configure and download the editor suited to your needs.

## Installing CKEditor&nbsp;5 using npm

<info-box>

**Prerequisites**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in version 18 or above
* An initialized Node.js project
* Basic familiarity with a terminal

</info-box>

Before running any command, make sure that your Node.js version is up-to-date. Also, check if you're in the proper working directory with the initialized Node.js project. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install ckeditor5
```

The command will install the CKEditor main open-source package alongside essential plugins. You can import all modules from the `ckeditor5` package. Additionally, you have to import UI translations and CSS styles separately.

## Next steps

* After installing the editor, you can learn more about configuration in the {@link getting-started/setup/configuration setup} section.
* Check the {@link features/index Features} category of the documentation to learn more about individual features.
